Yup, this seems like crazy talk. But hey, the world did flip inside-out/upside-down in 2020, so who knows who is right?

The fact is that there is fresh energy orbiting DAOcast. Fresh energy springing from [taoDAO](https://gitcoin.co/grants/1499/taodao) - an experimental DAO framework centered around cultural patterns, as opposed to technological tools. A DAO whose purpose is the co-creation of regenerative multimedia content. Or better yet, as Vinícius puts it in this episode: “It’s not only to produce regenerative content. But for you, yourself, to have a regen experience for your life, so you can report on that. So you can share that.”

Since taoDAO's inception DAOcast has been one of its main channels, so it was only a matter of time for these two initiatives to begin a fusion dance, whose outcome is unknown. In fact, the outcome is up to us to co-create. Yes, you and me.
