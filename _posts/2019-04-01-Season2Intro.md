## DAOcast is Back! And it is no joke!

![image](/assets/images/banners/s02welcome.png)

Come check the “Intro Catch-up” between Stratis and I (Danilo) on the “State of the DAO(cast)”.  There are a couple of experimental (and to me exciting)  changes to the show this “season”, and we talk about that here

This time I will at least try to reach out to other perspectives, and I'd be very happy if DAOcast could function as a platform for other people in "their quest" to understanding whatever a DAO is (or is not/can/ can not/ may/may not). Makes sense? [Come chat](https://t.me/joinchat/F8MHBxCYQUgthJoz8zaPXg)!

*This interview was recorded on March 20th, 2019. So please take that into consideration when listening to the show.*
